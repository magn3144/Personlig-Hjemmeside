                        In 2019 i attended a Danish folk high school, where i took the game design course. With my group i made several games. Cave Cart was the final project, which took a month to make. My main responsibility on the project was programming using Unity and C#. The game is similar to temple run. The player is driving a mine-cart in a tunnel with three tracks. To avoid obstacles like holes and explosive barrels the player switches tracks. the player gets points according to how long they survive and gets extra points by collecting pickups. The maze is procedurally generated, and the game is endless. The game also contains power-ups, a start screen, setting and credit scene.
